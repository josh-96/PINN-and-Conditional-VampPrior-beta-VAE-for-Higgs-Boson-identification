# Higgs Boson Identification with PINN and Conditional VampPrior β-VAE

This project combines state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to simulate detector data and identify the Higgs Boson signal in high-energy physics experiments. It leverages a **Conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE)** for synthetic data generation and **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** for physics-guided signal extraction.

## Project Overview
The goal is to address challenges in Higgs Boson detection caused by overwhelming background noise and complex detector responses. The workflow includes:
1. **Synthetic Data Generation**: A cVAE conditioned on event type (signal/background) generates realistic detector data, enhanced with a VampPrior and MMD loss for better distribution alignment.
2. **Signal Extraction**: A PINN incorporates physical constraints (e.g., invariant mass ≈ 125 GeV) to refine predictions.

## Key Features
- **Conditional VampPrior β-VAE (cVampPrior β-VAE)**: Generates synthetic data to augment limited real-world samples.
  - **VampPrior**: Improves latent space modeling.
  - **MMD Loss**: Ensures synthetic and real data distributions match.
- **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)**: Integrates domain knowledge (physical laws) into the model.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values (encoded as `-999.0`), one-hot encoding, and feature extraction.

## Installation
### Dependencies
- Python ≥3.7
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`/`pytorch`, `kaggle` (for data download)

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow kaggle

Kaggle Setup:

- Upload Kaggle API credentials (kaggle.json) to Colab or your working directory.

- Configure permissions:

mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json

Dataset
Source: Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge (Kaggle)

Features: 30 engineered features (e.g., transverse momentum, invariant mass).

Labels: Binary (s for signal, b for background).

Size:

Training: 250,000 samples.

Test: 550,000 samples.

Preprocessing
Missing values are marked as -999.0 and handled during training.

Features are standardized, and labels are one-hot encoded.

Methodology
1. Synthetic Data Generation (cVampPrior β-VAE)
- Architecture: Encoder-decoder with conditional labels.

- Loss: Combines reconstruction loss, KL divergence (VampPrior), and MMD regularization.

- Output: Augmented dataset balancing signal and background events.

2. PINN for Signal Extraction
- Physics Constraints: Penalizes deviations from known physics (e.g., invariant mass ≈ 125 GeV).

- Architecture: Fully connected network with residual connections.

Usage
1. Download Data:

!kaggle competitions download -c higgs-boson
!unzip higgs-boson.zip -d higgs_boson_data

2. Load and Preprocess Data:
import pandas as pd
training_data = pd.read_csv('training.zip/training.csv')
test_data = pd.read_csv('test.zip/test.csv')

3. Train cVampPrior β-VAE and PINN:

See the Jupyter notebook for model architectures and training loops.

Results
The cVampPrior β-VAE generates high-fidelity synthetic data, improving model robustness.

PINN achieves higher accuracy by enforcing physical consistency.

Evaluation metrics (e.g., ROC-AUC, MSE score, F1-score) are used to quantify performance.
